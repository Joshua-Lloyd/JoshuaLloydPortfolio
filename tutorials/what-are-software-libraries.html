				<h1>What Are Software Libraries?</h1>
			</div>
			
			<article>
				<p>Software libraries are off-the-shelf or bespoke software
				components that software uses to enhance its functionality.
				The extended functionality can be practically anything:
				GPS navigation, graphics rendering/rasterisation,
				peripheral I/O, neural networks, TCP/IP networked communication,
				computer vision, etc.</p>

				<p>Software libraries can be used and reused as components 
				in essentially any conceivable application. They're sometimes
				referred to as APIs (or part of an API, Application Programming Interface),
				SDK, or packages. Basically, they're a set of reusable
				software components (program and data) used to extend a program's functionality.</p>

				<h2>Where are they used?</h2>
				<p>Practically every software application you use will make use of an outsourced software
				library. Here are some examples that apply to building robots: </p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Inventor, and most other Computer Aided Design (CAD) packages likely
					either use OpenGL or Direct3D for their 3D graphics rendering. OpenGL
					is an open-source software library devoted to 3D graphics, where-as
					Direct3D is a proprietary, closed-sourced library which is part of the
					DirectX API and owned by Microsoft.</li>
					<li>
					<li>Office packages like Microsoft Word and LibreOffice might make use of libraries such as the Qt Framework
					for displaying graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or Boost for software constructs for back-end software
					constructs like complex lists and arrays/data structures.</li>
					<li>Some robots used in research environments like 
					the PR2 make use of the Robot Operating System (ROS)
					which is an open-source robotics software framework
					and toolkit providing an array of functionality
					including device driver access and a simulator.</li>
					<li>The software actually running a robot might be
					utilising a library for complex tasks such as
					networking with other robots, GPS navigation, 
					simaultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM,
					basically how a robot learns and navigates its
					environment), retrieving and storing data within 
					a database, interacting with device drivers 
					through a kernel such as Linux, etc.</li>
				</ul>


				<h2>How are software libraries made?</h2>
				<p>Software libraries are usually very complex
				and implemented close to hardware specs in the case of 
				tasks like 3D graphics rendering and TCP/IP networks.</p>

				<p>They're usually built by separate groups and 
				companies and distributed as off-the-shelf packages
				under a proprietary or open license. Some companies
				prefer to build their own software libraries, however
				it saves a lot of time and money to use one that's
				already been developed and tested rather than
				reinventing the wheel.</p>

				<p>I hope I have adequately explained software
				libraries to the robot creator. If you have questions
				or suggestions, please leave a comment and I'll get back
				to you as soon as possible.</p>
