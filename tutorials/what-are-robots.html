					<p>Robots are programmable machines designed to do
					a job. It does this by gathering information from
					its surroundings (sensing) then using the
					information to perform the appropriate actions to do
					its job.</p>

					<p>All robots have a purpose. Different purposes
					exist for different robots: some robots are built
					to clean; others are built to perform repetitive
					assembly work; others are built to pick up heavy 
					objects; other are even built for entertainment.</p>

					<p>Because of this disparity, robots can come in
					many different shapes and sizes, but there are 
					underlying principles that all robots have in
					common.</p>

					<h2>The Different Types of Robots</h2>

					<h3>Industrial Robots</h3>
					<p>Industrial robots are ones used in a
					manufacturing environment for processes such as 
					automated sorting, assembly, machining and
					fabrication, or painting. There are many kinds of
					industrial robots but the most recognized form is
					the robotic arm. Companies use industrial robots
					on their production/assembly lines because they're
					a cheaper and more efficient form of labour
					compared to humans. They also make less mistakes 
					because they're programmed to perform the same
					action continuously over long periods.</p>

					<h3>Domestic Robots</h3>
					<p>Domestic robots are ones that tend to be used by
					consumers instead of businesses. They can have a
					multitude of uses, including window cleaning,
					vacuum cleaning, sweeping, and even telepresence
					and surveillance.</p>

					<h3>Military Robots</h3>
					<p>Robots used for military applications. There
					exist robots that diffuse bombs and soon there
					will be robots that are capable of carrying cargo.
					Some countries even own sentries that fire at
					moving targets.</p>

					<h3>Other kinds</h3>
					<p>There are also robots used in a research
					environment and robots designed to help surgeons
					perform intricate tasks through a user-interface
					and end-effector. There are also robots built for
					entertainment like RC drones, robot dogs and dinos,
					and line-followers.</p>
