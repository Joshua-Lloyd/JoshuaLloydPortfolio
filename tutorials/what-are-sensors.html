					<h1>What is a Sensor?</h1>

					<p>A sensor is a device used to sense its
					surrounding environment. This could be in order to
					record data, react to external stimuli (such as when
					a robot "sees" a wall, stops, then moves around it),
					take in user input (a keyboard could be considered a
					"sensor", and especially things like microphones and
					cameras), etc. It basically takes just takes in data
					so the system can react to it.</p>

					<p>The word "sensor" is pretty vague and could be
					used to describe simple transducers (like
					piezoelectric components, thermistors or IR sensors),
					more complex systems of modules (like web cams,
					Arduino modules or microphones), and sometimes
					(but not so often) things like keyboards and mice.</p>

					<h2>Uses of Sensors</h2>

					<p>Without sensors, the system wouldn't know how to
					react in the environment. Robots incorporate many
					different sensors. These sensors could be to
					photograph the environment, know when it approaches
					a wall (like those hobbyist 3-wheelers), know when
					its being interacted with by the user, take in radio
					frequencies, sense variations in pressure (think of
					robot fingers), etc.</p>

					<p>Sensors can also be used as part of a feedback
					control system. For robots this feedback control
					could be used to keep both wheels/propellers
					spinning at the same speed - a sensor (probably a
					tachometer) would measure the wheel's rev speed
					then vary the power to the motors in order to
					regulate it.</p>

					<h2>Some Different Sensors</h2>
					<p>There are loads of different sensors. Here's some
					to get you started:

					<h3>Photoresistor (LDR)</h3>
					<p>Photoresistors are electronic devises that vary
					their electrical resistance based on the brightness
					of the light shown upon it. They're used to allow
					robots to distinguish varying levels of light in
					the environment in order to do things like detect
					and avoid walls, follow lines on the ground, follow 
					the bright light at the end of the tunnel, etc.</p>

					<h3>Piezoelectrics, Stress Gauges (and other things
					that change based on stress/pressure)</h3>
					<p>Piezoelectrics vary voltage depending on the
					amount of stress applied on the materials. They can
					be used to build stress gauges (which can also be
					considered sensors), robotic fingers (think of when
					a robot holds a coke can, how does it know how to 
					grasp it?), and microphones as sound pressures can
					also vary the voltage.</p>

					<h3>Cameras</h3>
					<p>Cameras are sensors too, and can allow the robot
					to view then interact with its environment with
					object recognition and facial recognition.</p>

					<h3>Ultrasonic Sensors and Modules</h3>
					<p>Ultrasonic sensors basically measure the 
					intensity of high-frequency sound. They're used to
					build modules like this one and can be used to allow
					the robot to avoid walls, build a mental map of its
					environment in order to navigate around and talk to
					bats.</p>

					<p>I hope that clarifies what sensor. Any 
					questions/suggestions let me know in the comments
					so I can improve it.</p>
