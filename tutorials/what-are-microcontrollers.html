					<p>Microcontrollers are integrated circuit (IC)
					computers. They're basically the whole computer 
					integrated into a single chip: </p>

					<p>They have everything that a computer would have 
					ideally: the CPU, I/O bus and memory.</p>

					<p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the part of
					the microcontroller responsible for performing
					arithmetic and Boolean logical calculations (such 
					as additions, subtractions, comparisons, etc.) as
					well as directing data between I/O and memory.</p>
					
					<p>Memory would usually be in a read-write volatile form
					such as RAM or EEPROM. This is where data and 
					program instructions are stored.</p>
					
					<p>I/O (input and output) bus are the sets of
					parallel wires that connect input devices (such as
					sensor modules and wireless recievers) and output
					devices (such as servomechanisms and LCD display
					modules) to the microcontroller. They act as an
					interface the the CPU/MCU.</p>
					
					<h2>What are microcontrollers used for?</h2>

					<p>Microcontrollers are used practically everywhere:
					washing machines, cars, airplanes, microwaves,
					remote controls, etc. Even more exciting, they're
					used for robots. They generally have three main
					purposes, sensing the environment and converting
					that data into data that can be processed by the
					"bigger brain", the "big brain" processor (which
					might be a microcontroller or a full-on computer
					running an Kernel or OS) which does all the main
					processes and higher level functions like AI, etc.
					and the output side microcontroller which takes 
					data given by the "big brain" and uses it to move
					end effectors and servos/motors, etc.</p>
